							Eastern Bridge is a consulting company specialising in international relations, particularly between New Zealand and Asia. We provide an advisory and facilitation service to assist New Zealand companies and organisations to develop new businesses and investment relationship with our Asian neighbours.
						</p>
						<p class="md-text">
							The concept was developed by Simon Appleton, who has for a number of years, worked in both the Public and Private sectors in New Zealand and in Asia. During this time the importance of Asia to New Zealand became apparent, as did the disconnect between New Zealand and our regional neighbours. Eastern Bridge Ltd aims to provide a market-orientated response to this disconnect and to bridge the gaps between New Zealand and Asia, while at the same time encouraging local economic development and community growth. 
						</p>
						<p class="md-text">
							Our small, highly motivated team of Asia specialists is committed to supporting your organisation whilst promoting sustainable economic growth.
