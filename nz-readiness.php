				There are many agents, consultants and migrant settlement services in New Zealand. Eastern Bridge is different from the majority of such businesses. 
			</p>
			<p class="intro-text-sm">
				We are strongly focused on regional New Zealand which we know offers a broad range of business and investment opportunities. This “local” emphasis is in contrast to the Auckland area with its focus on property investment and development. It is our aim to find opportunities which fulfil the aspirations of the clients but which also benefit the community in which they are based, thus providing strong, two-way goodwill into the future.

								For many migrant business owners it is difficult engaging with local customers or agencies because of language. Eastern Bridge has a service where we can look after your outgoing correspondence. This service takes away the risk of miscommunication due to language and cultural differences, as well as providing a 'local face' for your business.
